# Homebox-Net

This is an extremely experimental version of the Homebox backend written in .NET 8. It is not intended for production use
or use in general.

This is just an experiment to determine if there would be any significant improvements to moving the backend to .NET and
does not mean that we actually plan to migrate.

Please see our [homebox](https://github.com/sysadminsmedia/homebox) repository for the latest releases and information regarding the active production version of
Homebox.
